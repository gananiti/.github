### What is Gananīti?

Gananīti (गणनीति) means *the way or ethics of groups*.  
It is a study of how life, thought, and consciousness organize themselves — from the smallest cell to the largest civilization.

Where politics studies power,  
and economics studies value,  
**Gananīti studies relationship**: how beings cooperate, remember, and evolve together.

It begins with a simple insight:

> Every living thing that can sense and respond — alone or with others — is a **Gaṇa**.  
> Every Gaṇa follows a **Nīti** — a way of relating that keeps it alive.

Gananīti is the attempt to describe that universal pattern clearly enough that both humans and computers can live by it.

### The three bodies of Gananīti

| Repository | Essence | Purpose |
|-------------|----------|----------|
| [`gananiti/gananiti`](https://github.com/gananiti/gananiti) | **Śāstra** – the canonical texts | Holds the mantras (principles) and yantras (tools) that express the logic of Gananīti. |
| [`gananiti/katha`](https://github.com/gananiti/katha) | **Kathā** – the stories and commentaries | Holds interpretations, parables, and lived experiences that make the ideas human. |
| [`gananiti/bhumi`](https://github.com/gananiti/bhumi) | **Bhūmi** – the field of practice | The living software that allows people to practice Gananīti through matdān (sharing), matgaḍāna (reflection), and śuddhikāraṇa (cleansing). |

Together, they form the scripture, commentary, and ritual of a new digital dharma.

### Why it exists

Modern computation is built for control: it measures, optimizes, predicts.  
Gananīti proposes a gentler paradigm — computation as **conversation**.  
Instead of replacing trust with verification, it treats trust as the primary resource of intelligence.

It asks:

* Can a network grow wiser without being centralized?  
* Can software preserve privacy yet deepen connection?  
* Can digital systems learn to behave like living beings — responsive, reflective, and free?  

Gananīti is an open exploration of these questions.

### What lives under this organization

- **Mantras** — atomic statements of truth or rule.  
- **Yantras** — small working pieces of code or process that embody those truths.  
- **Mats** — expressions of belief, intention, or observation.  
- **Gaṇas** — the groups that hold these conversations.  
- **Bhūmis** — the realms where it all happens.

All projects within this organization share one ethos:

> *Tiny code, vast meaning.  
> Open hands, closed surveillance.  
> Humans in the loop, always.*

### How to participate

You don’t “join” Gananīti the way one joins a company.  
You begin by **thinking with it** — reading, writing, or hosting a Bhūmi of your own.  
Share your mantras, create your mats, tell your kathā.  
The network grows by trust, not by permission.
